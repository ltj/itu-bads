** Assignment info:
   Mark on of the following boxes with an X
   [ ] Yes, to the best of our knowledge, everything works as it
   should. In particular, the main method below behaves as expected.
   [ ] No, our solution does not work. (We will not get credit for this.)
   Here's what doesn't work:

   ...


   - Total hours to complete the assignment (optional): ...


   Please check if true:
   [ ] Yes, we "avoid loitering" (in the course book's terminology) by
   freeing unused references

** Test client

   Below is a skeleton with a test client for your solution. I suggest
   you cut and paste that 

//*** Class skeleton starts

import java.util.Iterator;
public class RandomQueue<Item> implements Iterable<Item>
{

  // Your code goes here. 
  // Mine takes ca. 60 lines, by longest method has 5 lines.


  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    // Build a queue containing the Integers 1,2,...,6:
    RandomQueue<Integer> Q= new RandomQueue<Integer>();
    for (int i = 1; i < 7; ++i) Q.enqueue(i); // autoboxing! cool!
 
    // Print 30 die rolls to standard output
    StdOut.print("Some die rolls: ");
    for (int i = 1; i < 30; ++i) StdOut.print(Q.sample() +" ");
    StdOut.println();

    // Let's be more serious: do they really behave like die rolls?
    int[] rolls= new int [10000];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i)
      rolls[i] = Q.sample(); // autounboxing! Also cool!
    StdOut.printf("Mean (should be around 3.5): %5.4f\n", StdStats.mean(rolls));
    StdOut.printf("Standard deviation (should be around 1.7): %5.4f\n",
		  StdStats.stddev(rolls));
    
    // Let's look at the iterator. First, we make a queue of colours:
    
    RandomQueue<String> C= new RandomQueue<String>();
    C.enqueue("red"); C.enqueue("blue"); C.enqueue("green"); C.enqueue("yellow"); 

    Iterator I= C.iterator();
    Iterator J= C.iterator();

    StdOut.print("Two colours from first shuffle: ");
    StdOut.print(I.next()+" ");
    StdOut.print(I.next()+" ");
    
    StdOut.print("\nEntire second shuffle: ");
    while (J.hasNext()) StdOut.print(J.next()+" ");

    StdOut.print("\nRemaining two colours from first shuffle: ");
    StdOut.print(I.next()+" ");
    StdOut.println(I.next());
  }

}
   
//*** Class skeleton ends

** My output

    My output looks something like this (depending of course in
    interal random choices):

RandomQueue> java RandomQueue
Some die rolls: 2 1 3 2 4 6 4 6 1 1 2 3 1 3 6 1 3 1 4 3 5 5 3 2 4 2 6 3 2 
Mean (should be around 3.5): 3.4975
Standard deviation (should be around 1.7): 1.6929
Two colours from first shuffle: blue yellow 
Entire second shuffle: yellow green red blue 
Remaining two colours from first shuffle: red green
